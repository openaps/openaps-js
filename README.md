# [DEPRECATED] openaps-js

Historical Deprecated Javascript plugins for openaps

The openaps-js toolset has been deprecated and replaced by [oref0](https://github.com/openaps/oref0).
If you're not already using openaps-js, please use oref0 instead.
If you have an openaps implementation using openaps-js,
I would recommend setting up a new loop, on a new Pi or at least
in a new directory, using oref0.  For more information, see the
[openaps/docs](https://github.com/openaps/docs).

By proceeding using these tools or any piece within, you agree to the
copyright (see LICENSE.txt for more information) and release any
contributors from liability. 

*Note:* OpenAPS is intended to be a set of tools to support a self-driven DIY
implementation and any person choosing to use these tools is solely
responsible for testing and implement these tools independently or
together as a system.  The [DIY part of OpenAPS is important]
(http://bit.ly/1NBbZtO). While formal training or experience as an
engineer or a developer is not required, what *is* required is a growth
mindset to learn what are essentially "building blocks" to implement an
OpenAPS instance. This is not a "set and forget" system; it requires
diligent and consistent testing and monitoring to ensure each piece of
the system is monitoring, predicting, and performing as desired.  The
performance and quality of your system lies solely with you.
