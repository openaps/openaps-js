# Introduction

This project implements a blood-glucose calculator, with automatic adjustment of
basal rates.

The intention of this is to create a closed-loop OpenAPS implementation.

The repository also includes tools to configure a Raspberry Pi to run this
implementation.

# Warning

Although some people are using this, it is *NOT* ready for general use. It is
very much a work in progress! See http://openaps.org and
http://diyps.org/2015/03/31/why-the-diy-part-of-openaps-is-important/ for a
sense of what this project is about.
